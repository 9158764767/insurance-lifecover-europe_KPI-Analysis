## Overview

This report explores synthetic KPIs and models the likelihood of purchasing life cover across European countries.
It demonstrates an end-to-end workflow: EDA, unsupervised clustering, and supervised classification.
Python and R are both used in this project.

## Data

- `eu_kpis_synthetic.csv` contains country-level KPIs:
  - Purchasing power index
  - Health coverage (%)
  - Aged 65+ population (%)
  - GDP per capita (USD)
  - Synthetic life-cover likelihood (0â€“1) and a binary label

## Methods

- **Clustering**: KMeans (k=3) on standardized KPIs, then 2D PCA for visualization.
- **Classification**: Logistic Regression and Random Forest using KPIs + cluster ID.
- **Metrics**: Precision/Recall/F1, ROC-AUC.

## Results Summary (to fill in after running Python pipeline)

- See `report/metrics.json` and `report/country_summary.csv`.
- Interactive plots in `plots/`:
  - Pairwise KPI scatter matrix (`pairwise_scatter.html`)
  - Correlation heatmap (`corr_heatmap.html`)
  - PCA clusters (`pca_clusters.html` / `r_pca_clusters.html`)
  - RF feature importance (`rf_feature_importance.html`)
  - ROC curve (`roc_random_forest.html`)

## Interpretation

Clusters group countries with similar economic and demographic profiles.
Classification uses those patterns to predict life cover purchasing likelihood.
In production, replace synthetic KPIs with Eurostat/World Bank indicators for real analysis.
